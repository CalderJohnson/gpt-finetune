Bachelor of Computer Science Programs
Computer Science - Both general and honours programs are offered, leading to the degree of Bachelor of
Computer Science (B.C.S.). Each permits the student to augment a specialized study of computers with
an extensive study of one of a number of related fields, or with a broad spectrum of other courses. A Cooperative Education program is offered in Honours Computer Science. Also offered are B.Sc. programs
leading to degrees in Computer Information Systems Specialization, or with Software Engineering
Specialization.

PROGRAM AND CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION
REGULATIONS
ENGLISH PROFICIENCY
It is highly recommended that students take English ENGL-1001 (Composition) as students in Computer
Science should develop good oral and written communications skills, besides technical proficiency in the
basic science.
SELECTION OF COURSES
In selecting courses to meet the requirements of the programs outlined below, the following general
regulations also must be observed:
1) A student registering in a course without having successfully completed the prerequisite course(s) will
be required to drop that course unless the consent of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his
designate) is obtained.
2) If two or more courses cover essentially the same material, only one may be taken for credit.
3) The prior approval of the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate) must be obtained in
order to substitute any courses for required ones.
4) Statistics courses other than those specifically listed as being required for the degree, or ones for
which the required statistics courses are themselves prerequisites, may not be taken for credit.
5) In general, Computer Science courses offered in other areas may not be taken for credit. COMP-1047,
COMP-2067, COMP-2057, COMP-2077, COMP-2707, and COMP-3057 may not be used to satisfy the
major requirements of any degree program in Computer Science, or in joint programs with Computer
Science, unless permission is obtained from the Director of Computer Science (or her/his designate).

CO-OPERATIVE EDUCATION
The Co-operative Education Program is available for the following degrees:
Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours)
Bachelor of Computer Science (Honours Applied Computing)
Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Information Systems)
Bachelor of Science (Honours Computer Science with Software Engineering Specialization)
Introduction
The Co-operative Education Program offers students the opportunity to combine their classroom
experiences with related work experiences. Students who apply and are accepted into the Co-operative
Education Program must successfully complete at least three paid work experiences interspersed
throughout the four-year Honours program. The experience gained while participating in these
structured and supervised work placements is viewed as an integral component of the student's
educational program.

All Co-op positions must be full-time, paid, related to the degree program and approved by the
University. The process of securing a Co-op position is competitive. Co-op students will apply for work
opportunities as advertised by the Centre for Career Education using an Internet-based software
program and employers will make interview and hiring decisions. Students are also encouraged to seek
Co-op employment outside of the advertised postings by completing a guided job search process
facilitated by the Centre for Career Education.
Academic Regulations
Computer Science Co-op students must maintain full-time academic status and satisfy the following:
(a) Must maintain a minimum average of 60%, and
(b) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65%,
(c) Must not have more than one grade below 50% on their transcript, and;
(d) Must maintain a minimum major average of 65% during the one semester probation period.
General Information
Withdrawal from the Co-op program will be granted on an exception basis only as it must be determined
that the student has no outstanding commitments to employers. Students who wish to withdraw must
meet with a Co-op Coordinator and complete a withdrawal form. However, the only time a student may
withdraw from an undergraduate Co-op program without further Co-op fee payment implications is by
the 1st Friday of classes after their first Co-op work term. Students who withdraw from Co-operative
Education at any other time will be liable for paying the Co-op fee for the term in which they are
dropping and one additional term. This will help offset the costs of developing another student for
placement.
In the interest of building solid partnerships with employers, students who have accepted a Co-op
employment offer (either by ranking a position in round 1 of the job competition or by accepting a
position either verbally or in writing in later rounds) must honour that commitment. Therefore, once
students have accepted an offer of employment for a work term, they will be considered registered in
the appropriate work term course and must remain in the Co-op program until they have completed
their work term requirements. Failure to honour these commitments and/or to complete all work term
requirements will lead to being required to withdraw from the Co-op program and will result in a failing
grade on his/her transcript for that work term.
